sidebar_label: 3.3.4.3
slug: /release-history/release-notes/3-3-4-3
---

### Behavioral Changes and Compatibility

1. snode must be used in multi-replica stream computing
1. Added a compatibility assurance mechanism for stream computing to avoid compatibility issues with subsequent function changes. However, stream computing in previous versions must be rebuilt.
1. Adjusted the method for determining the result type of the case when statement

### New Features

1. New feature: TWA function in stream computing supports time-driven result push mode
1. New feature: Interp function in stream computing supports time-driven result push mode
1. New feature: Support for Microsoft object storage

### Optimizations

1. Optimization: Improved efficiency of data pulling between nodes during concurrent large queries
1. Optimization: Support for using AVX2 and AVX512 to optimize decoding for double, timestamp, and bigint types
1. Optimization: Adjusted the method for determining the result type of the case when statement
1. Optimization: Improved error logging during sequential execution of compact and split vgroup operations
1. Optimization: Increased data scan speed for queries like “select ... from ... where ts in (...)”
1. Optimization: Added a compatibility assurance mechanism for stream computing to avoid compatibility issues with subsequent function changes. Stream computing in previous versions must be rebuilt
1. Optimization: Improved data synchronization performance of taosX in cross-writing scenarios
1. Optimization: Support for disabling encoding of integer/floating-point types
1. Optimization: snode must be used in multi-replica stream computing
1. Optimization: Client generates a unique ID for each query task to avoid memory corruption caused by duplicate IDs
1. Optimization: Accelerated database creation time
1. Optimization: Changed the default value of s3MigrateEnabled to 0
1. Optimization: Support for recording delete operations in the audit database
1. Optimization: Support for creating databases in specified dnodes [Enterprise Edition]
1. Optimization: Adjusted error messages when deleting columns from supertables
